### Hi, I'm Matt 👋

My journey in data analytics, began a little over five years ago, when I first became a Claims Supervisor at Farmers Insurance. My goal was to become a more efficient supervisor and to gain deeper insight into what drove my team's performance. Through hours of practice and application, I became highly proficient in data analysis and data visualization tools, such as Microsoft Excel, SQL, Python, Alteryx, Tableau, Power BI.   After becoming proficient with these tools, I was able to expand my influence and positively contribute to my claims operation. 

In 2018, I was nominated for Farmers Insurance’s prestigious Passion for Excellence Award for the design, development and maintenance of a dynamic excel reporting dashboard, which consolidated claims management key performance indicators and helped spur a 19% increase in the percentage of claims closed within 90 days

When I am not in the office, I enjoy working on data science projects, watching movies or playing basketball.  To learn more about my current data science projects, please visit my portfolio website, [https://www.matthewlawrencesnell.com/](https://www.matthewlawrencesnell.com/). </div>
